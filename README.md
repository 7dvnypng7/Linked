Physical coupling of vehicles

We evision modular electric automated vehicles that weigh less than the riders. Such vehicles are supported by other code in the Elcano repository. The Linked repository contains CAD files for mechanical parts that allow vehicles to couple into a road train that behaves as a single vehicle. The Linked repository will also contain software to enable vehicles to dock and undock.
Automated vehicles travelling in platoons reduce energy consumption and increase road capacity. The effects are better with a smaller gap between vehicles. However, a small gap results in a jerky ride as the vehicle constantly adjusts its following distance. Our solution is to shrink the gap to zero and drive bumper-to-bumper. Students at University of Washington, Bothell have developed a prototype couple that allows two vehicles to join together or separate while moving. The mechanism includes a spring to eliminate jerks.
